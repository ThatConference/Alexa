The command line interface is incredibly powerful, once you understand how it works. With the CLI, you can manage your files, manipulate data, and automate your operating system, creating workflows that work for you.  And with the Windows Subsystem for Linux, Windows users have the same access to tools that Linux and Mac users have enjoyed for years.\r\nIn this beginner-focused hands-on workshop, you'll get comfortable with the command line environment. You'll manage files and directories, learning shortcuts to create complex structures for your projects. Then you'll do a little network debugging. Then you'll search and replace text in files, learn how to redirect data to files or other programs, and finally write scripts to automate it all.\r\n When you're done you'll be able to incorporate your new skills into your daily workflow.\r\n\r\nSpecific instructions will be sent to all registered attendees one week before the event to ensure that you can participate fully.",

The command line interface is incredibly powerful, once you understand how it works. With the CLI, you can manage your files, manipulate data, and automate your operating system, creating workflows that work for you.  And with the Windows Subsystem for Linux, Windows users have the same access to tools that Linux and Mac users have enjoyed for years.\r\nIn this beginner-focused hands-on workshop, you'll get comfortable with the command line environment. You'll manage files and directories, learning shortcuts to create complex structures for your projects. Then you'll do a little network debugging. Then you'll search and replace text in files, learn how to redirect data to files or other programs, and finally write scripts to automate it all.\r\nWhen you're done you'll be able to incorporate your new skills into your daily workflow.</p>\r\n<p>Specific instructions will be sent to all registered attendees one week before the event to ensure that you can participate fully.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Connected solutions are used every day to solve hard problems, but one of the best ways to learn how to build those solutions is through play, which is what this workshop is about: exploring the ins and outs of building real IoT solutions though the construction of a connected conference badge. That’s right, it’s time to being #BadgeLife to That Conference.\r\n \r\nIn this hands-on workshop, Brandon Satrom, Particle Developer Evangelist, will provide an in-depth walkthrough of the Particle ecosystem, including:\r\n- Unique features of the Particle device OS firmware;\r\n- The powerful Particle Device Cloud. \r\n- A look at Particle’s new 3rd generation, mesh-ready hardware.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of this workshop, you’ll have a working, Particle-powered badge that will set you apart for the rest of the conference, and which you’ll use to participate in a live scavenger hunt during the event. Even better, you’ll walk away with all the tools you need to build your own connected solutions with Particle. \r\nYou’ll have fun. You’ll learn something. You’ll get some free stuff.

    "Description": "When it comes to DevOps, you can’t spell it properly without good software management (aka package management). Behind every great infrastructure management solution out there is a great package manager. Windows has long been left out of the conversation for DevOps due to a lacking solution for package management. Worse, with Windows, over 80% of the management and configuration deals with software installation management.\r\n\r\nHowever over the past 7 years, Chocolatey has become the de facto software management solution for Windows.

Michael and Diana will take you through a soup-to-nuts experience where you will learn how to craft  natural-sounding dialogue that will emotionally connect users with your bot, using examples of VUI scripts, screenplays, improv exercises and writing tips. By the time you leave, be prepared to have learned how to write, lo-fi prototype, code, launch and test your very own bot.\r\nWhat to bring:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An idea for a voice bot that's been stirring around in your head</li>\r\n<li>A computer</li>\r\n<li>Pen and paper</li>\r\n<li>You smartphone (if you have one) with the Google app installed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n",

She completed her teacher training at Tosa Yoga Center in Wauwatosa in November 2017, and has attended multiple workshops and taken classes with respected teachers in the field including Richard Freeman, Kathryn Budig, Amy Ippoliti, Gwen Lawrence, Rod Stryker, and Erica Mather. In her classes, she focuses on using poses to improve flexibility and strength, and to foster a sense of inner calm and relaxation.

    "Description": "Heard of Vue.js and wonder what it's all about? I can fix that.\r\n\r\nCome watch me demonstrate Vue.js basics with live-coded examples. My in-depth explanations will help you understand what Vue is doing under the covers. Along the way you'll start to understand why so many developers love Vue.js.\r\nBring your laptop if you want to follow along. Code will be shared on Github prior to session.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n- 10 mins:  What is Vue.js? Who created it? Why is it so popular among developers? (spoilers: simple, small, performant, reactive)\r\n- 30 mins: Live-coded demo and explanation of basic Vue.js constructs (v-bind, v-if/v-show, v-for, v-on, v-model, etc).\r\n- 05 mins: Use these basics to live-code a Todo app in less than 5 mins (time me)\r\n- 05 mins: Links to resources for further exploration\r\n- 10 mins: Q&A\r\n\r\nWhat you'll get out of it:\r\n- Never used a JavaScript framework? This is the perfect *slow* intro where you'll really understand what's happening. If you've tried Angular or React and given up in frustration, you'll be pleasantly surprised by Vue.\r\n- Experienced Angular or React developer? You'll see many similarities in Vue.

Only 40% of grade schools teach any computer programming, and only 15 states have created K-12 computer science standards. \r\n\r\nLooking closer, the percent of women in technology has been in a free fall since 1991 and continues to drop. Woman and girls are being left behind. \r\n\r\nWhile interest in computer science ebbs over time, the biggest drop off for girls happens between the ages of 13-17.\r\n\r\nIt’s time for all of us to step up and show the girls of tomorrow they are our future. Girls Who Code is here to help you fill that need. A national profit gives volunteers the tools and training to launch their on clubs and programs. \r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn how to start your own Girls Who Code Club. From initial paperwork, time requirements, locking in a location, getting students to join, how funding works, provided curriculum and how to get more donations for your members.

Only 40% of grade schools teach any computer programming, and only 15 states have created K-12 computer science standards.</p>\r\n<p>Looking closer, the percent of women in technology has been in a free fall since 1991 and continues to drop. Woman and girls are being left behind.</p>\r\n<p>While interest in computer science ebbs over time, the biggest drop off for girls happens between the ages of 13-17.</p>\r\n<p>It’s time for all of us to step up and show the girls of tomorrow they are our future. Girls Who Code is here to help you fill that need. A national profit gives volunteers the tools and training to launch their on clubs and programs.</p>\r\n<p>In this session you will learn how to start your own Girls Who Code Club. From initial paperwork, time requirements, locking in a location, getting students to join, how funding works, provided curriculum and how to get more donations for your members. I will also answer all your questions you are already thinking about...Do you have to know how to program to start a club? Can boys join? And more.</p>\r\n\r\n",

This really isn't a problem unless it starts affecting our ability to succeed in school, at our jobs, and with our family. Attention Deficit Disorder is something I discovered I had as an adult when I realized I couldn't overcome issues that were affecting my ability to do my job well. I have discovered though that the tools that I've put together over the years to succeed aren't just for people with ADD/ADHD - they can help anyone struggling to stay focused.

He's still that feisty nerd, but at least now he gets paid to do it.\r\n\r\nAaron's interest in mobile software has been ever increasing since he got his first iOS app in Apple's App Store in 2009, Migraine Diary. He is with Automattic (WordPress.com, Akismet, SimpleNote) as a Mobile Maker.

        "BiographyHtml": "<p>Aaron was that kid taking apart the mechanical and electrical appliances at five years of age to see how they worked. He never grew out of that core interest - to know how things work. He took an early interest in computer programming, figuring out how to get past security to be able to play games on his dad's computer. He's still that feisty nerd, but at least now he gets paid to do it.</p>\r\n<p>Aaron's interest in mobile software has been ever increasing since he got his first iOS app in Apple's App Store in 2009, Migraine Diary. He is with Automattic (WordPress.com, Akismet, SimpleNote) as a Mobile Maker. Other than software development, Aaron enjoys camping during the summer, taking his dogs for a walk around the neighborhood, and pretending to be a storm chaser while sitting at home.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Our obsession with screens, push notifications, same day delivery, short video clips, and every other nearly-instant gratification is training our brains to think differently. This really isn't a problem unless it starts affecting our ability to succeed in school, at our jobs, and with our family. Attention Deficit Disorder is something I discovered I had as an adult when I realized I couldn't overcome issues that were affecting my ability to do my job well. I have discovered though that the tools that I've put together over the years to succeed aren't just for people with ADD/ADHD - they can help anyone struggling to stay focused. This session is practical in nature - learn how to discover when your brain is tricking you and the things you can do to get back on track.</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "Description": "Technology is a wonderful thing.  It improves our lives in ways far too many to list, but there is also a downside that we are just now starting to truly understand.  Many of us are now hooked, especially to our mobile phones.  We will have some fun looking at this phenomenon, but you will also come away with real steps you can take to change your life.  I want to put you back in charge of your technology, not your technology being in charge of you!  \r\n3 Takeaways from this session \r\nThere is real science behind our love affair with our iPhone, and we will explore it and what it means for you.\r\n1.\tHow does technology affect our children in the short and long term?  (hint:…It’s not very good…)\r\n2.\tYou will take away several specific action items you can implement tomorrow that will help you to regain control of your schedule, your career, and your sanity!\r\nIs your iPhone in charge of you are you in charge of it? and I say give your honest with yourself you're not gonna like the answer… think about it. When it beeps and beeps you come running. When it tells you it is time to do things you do them.  When you want to know how much money you have you ask your phone. It even has replaced your best-friend as the person who sets you up on blind dates. Now your next date is a swipe away from your cellphone overlord \r\nTechnology and our Kids:\r\n92% of teens go online at least once a day.  26% are on “constantly”\r\n50% of teens have admitted that they “cannot live without their phones\r\n77% of teens admit to arguing with their parents about technology use.\r\nKids measure themselves by “likes”\r\nGeneration  Y (the Millennials) have the lowest self-esteem of ANY generation in history.\r\nGirls dominate social media; boys are more likely to play video games\r\nThe dopamine released by the use of social media is extremely desirable for teens who are going through the stress of adolescence.\r\nFacebook usage is directly linked to depressive symptoms \r\nThe result of this is that young people have a harder time forming “deep. meaningful relationships” with their friends.\r\nThey haven’t practiced the skills to cope with real-world anxieties, and they turn to their devices for comfort, not other people.\r\n",

She loves how her practice on the mat transfers to other aspects of her life as a wife, mom, online English teacher, triathlete, and coach. She completed her teacher training at Tosa Yoga Center in Wauwatosa in November 2017, and has attended multiple workshops and taken classes with respected teachers in the field including Richard Freeman, Kathryn Budig, Amy Ippoliti, Gwen Lawrence, Rod Stryker, and Erica Mather. In her classes, she focuses on using poses to improve flexibility and strength, and to foster a sense of inner calm and relaxation. Stephanie's classes are thoughtfully crafted to leave her students feeling strong, peaceful, and balanced. ",

    "Description": "Feedback loop is easily the most effective way to improve individual and team performance. When it is given well and received willingly, feedback can be a powerful ally in growing happy teams who work together effectively to deliver great software. Here's the challenge: giving and receiving feedback are skills, and many of us haven't had the chance to develop those skills. Maybe we find giving feedback intimidating. Maybe receiving feedback makes us feel defensive. Maybe we simply haven't had much positive experience with open, honest conversations about performance. It's not easy to do feedback \"right\", and when it is given badly or received poorly, feedback can cause a team's relationships to disintegrate. This talk will introduce the fundamentals of effective feedback; provide strategies for giving, receiving, and processing feedback; and discuss the challenges and rewards of using feedback as a tool to improve team performance.\r\n",

When it is given well and received willingly, feedback can be a powerful ally in growing happy teams who work together effectively to deliver great software. Here's the challenge: giving and receiving feedback are skills, and many of us haven't had the chance to develop those skills. Maybe we find giving feedback intimidating. Maybe receiving feedback makes us feel defensive. Maybe we simply haven't had much positive experience with open, honest conversations about performance. It's not easy to do feedback &quot;right&quot;, and when it is given badly or received poorly, feedback can cause a team's relationships to disintegrate. This talk will introduce the fundamentals of effective feedback; provide strategies for giving, receiving, and processing feedback; and discuss the challenges and rewards of using feedback as a tool to improve team performance.</p>\r\n\r\n",

    "Description": "_tl;dr - Write less (but safer!) code in your Android apps or any JVM-based projects_\r\n\r\nEver work on an Android app and tire of all the boilerplate code?  Or spend hours chasing down NullPointerExceptions in your Java app?  Enter Kotlin, JetBrains' new(ish) free, open-source programming language that targets the JVM.  This means you can use it everywhere you use Java, but with a modern, succinct syntax.\r\n\r\nFor native Android developers, Kotlin is not only available, but it's now considered a first-class language.   You're able to write an app completely with Kotlin, or switch over entire components, or even just change your models to Kotlin's data classes (which removes a TON of boilerplate code.)\r\n \r\nOh, and for anyone using Java elsewhere, you can add in Kotlin code to your existing application.

    "Title": "3 Mathematical Concepts that Every Developer Should Know",
    "Description": "Not all developers need Category Theory or Linear Algebra. But every developer can benefit from Logic, Graph Theory, and Degrees of Freedom. Even if you don't think you are good at math, these are the skills that you use every day. You are a better mathematician than you give yourself credit for. Let's formalize those skills so that you can apply them with confidence.\r\n\r\nWe'll identify the Degrees of Freedom of a problem. Then we'll see how those degrees of freedom manifest in the solution. This will help us create better MVVM applications, better APIs, and better relational database models.\r\n\r\nWe'll learn some of the cool properties of Directed Acyclic Graphs, and how they help us track dependencies, and construct data models. We'll apply that knowledge to traversing those graphs in a way that always produces the correct result with the minimum necessary work.\r\n\r\nWe'll practice some of the tools of Predicate Calculus, and see how it helps us specify better requirements, and express concise queries. From that, we'll ensure that we've covered every edge case without overly complicating our code.\r\n\r\nMath is not hard. Writing proofs is not complicated. In fact, it's exactly like writing programs.",

Let's formalize those skills so that you can apply them with confidence.</p>\r\n<p>We'll identify the Degrees of Freedom of a problem. Then we'll see how those degrees of freedom manifest in the solution. This will help us create better MVVM applications, better APIs, and better relational database models.</p>\r\n<p>We'll learn some of the cool properties of Directed Acyclic Graphs, and how they help us track dependencies, and construct data models. We'll apply that knowledge to traversing those graphs in a way that always produces the correct result with the minimum necessary work.</p>\r\n<p>We'll practice some of the tools of Predicate Calculus, and see how it helps us specify better requirements, and express concise queries.

We all know we *should* be using them when we write our front end code, but we end up putting it off for another project down the road. And when SVGs are used, they are often implemented in a way that doesn’t unlock their full potential.\r\n\r\nDuring this presentation, we’ll discuss the best practices for SVG implementation and how they vary depending on the size and audience of your site. We will also go through what an SVG sprite is, how to create one, and why they’re awesome. According to Advanced Web Ranking.com, only 3% of sites on the internet use this technique...but 97% of browsers support it!\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you’ll be ready to work on your SVGs like you’ll be ready to work on your summer body!",

We all know we <em>should</em> be using them when we write our front end code, but we end up putting it off for another project down the road. And when SVGs are used, they are often implemented in a way that doesn’t unlock their full potential.</p>\r\n<p>During this presentation, we’ll discuss the best practices for SVG implementation and how they vary depending on the size and audience of your site. We will also go through what an SVG sprite is, how to create one, and why they’re awesome. According to Advanced Web Ranking.com, only 3% of sites on the internet use this technique...but 97% of browsers support it!</p>\r\n<p>After this talk, you’ll be ready to work on your SVGs like you’ll be ready to work on your summer body!</p>\r\n\r\n",

Born, designed, nurtured, and backed by Google, Flutter combines the nimble Dart programing language, the speedy and feature-rich Skia graphics engine, and a growing community of professional developers.

We will introduce the Flutter tools, platform, and development lifecycle to see the promise and delivery of some exciting advancements like \"hot reloading\" and \"visual debugging\" and a trip to the \"observatory\". The Flutter core design features are very attractive because of the ability to quickly develop, instantly test, debug, build and release a cross-platform mobile application.  A combination of live demonstrations and development will illustrate the benefits and challenges of the rookie and still evolving Flutter toolset, that shows it to have the promise of a future all-star.\r\n\r\nWe will take half of our time on safari to introduce and demo the new Flutter platform, languages, frameworks, and development lifecycle.

We'll explore how to use Terraform to define and set up a cloud server, and then use Ansible to install the server software and upload the web site. Then we'll modify our infrastructure code to scale out our solution with a load balancer. We'll do all of this without ever directly logging in to the server. \r\nYou'll get a taste of immutable infrastructure, and we'll discuss the benefits and limitations of this approach. Best of all, you'll be able to put this technique to use right away, because when we're done, you'll have scripts you can run to set up your own environment.",

In this talk, you'll see how to build a load-balanced web server using code.   We'll explore how to use Terraform to define and set up a cloud server, and then use Ansible to install the server software and upload the web site. Then we'll modify our infrastructure code to scale out our solution with a load balancer. We'll do all of this without ever directly logging in to the server.\r\nYou'll get a taste of immutable infrastructure, and we'll discuss the benefits and limitations of this approach. Best of all, you'll be able to put this technique to use right away, because when we're done, you'll have scripts you can run to set up your own environment.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Seems like these days you practically need a degree in psychology to get this right. But you don’t. \r\nOver my past 6 years at Polaris, I’ve worked with clients to develop high performing agile teams. I’ve found that regardless of technology, structure, and focus (software development, marketing, sales), there are patterns to what makes teams successful, and what can hold them back from greatness. In this talk, I’ll walk through what we've learned about building strong teams including how to recognize psychological preferences and innate strengths, how to be a strong leader to support your team as they learn to become high performing together, and a quick review of a tool you can use for uncovering the strengths of your individual team members. \r\nThroughout the discussion, I'll share my own personal experiences and insights to help you learn how you can build stronger teams too!

She loves how her practice on the mat transfers to other aspects of her life as a wife, mom, online English teacher, triathlete, and coach. She completed her teacher training at Tosa Yoga Center in Wauwatosa in November 2017, and has attended multiple workshops and taken classes with respected teachers in the field including Richard Freeman, Kathryn Budig, Amy Ippoliti, Gwen Lawrence, Rod Stryker, and Erica Mather. In her classes, she focuses on using poses to improve flexibility and strength, and to foster a sense of inner calm and relaxation. Stephanie's classes are thoughtfully crafted to leave her students feeling strong, peaceful, and balanced. ",

The concepts aren’t hard, but thinking functionality when coming from an OO mindset can be difficult.</p>\r\n<p>In this talk, we are going to talk about functional programming using JavaScript. We will introduce the benefits of functional programming. Techniques such as pure function and immutability will be delved into. We will talk about the negative impact of side effects and global variables. Finally, we will examine the use of the main functional keywords in JavaScript; map, reduce and filter.\r\nCome jump into the world of functional programing with JavaScript in this demo filled presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n",

While last year we focused on the basic ways to use your scrum board, this year we'll be looking at even more applications to all of your projects. Family trip? Yes. School Project? Yes. Cleaning your house, remodeling a bathroom, daily homework assignments? Yes, Yes, and YES! Hopefully at this session you will gain some insights into how scrum-ified your life can become (Seriously, I have a scrum board right now that has &quot;Write That Conference Abstract&quot; on it).\r\nCome to the Scrum side... we have Kudos!</p>\r\n\r\n",

And I was a nervous wreck! We were launching a\r\nnew product during a commercial at the Super Bowl 302 days away, and I\r\nwas betting everything on a technology we had never used in production.\r\nI spent countless nights wavering back and forth thinking about the\r\nmillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of person hours that were\r\non the line. Everything was resting on the shoulders of this one web\r\nservice that had to handle the excessive load placed upon it when our\r\ncommercial aired. The technology chosen was Erlang, a mystical,\r\nfunctional, dynamically compiled language that was very foreign to this\r\neight-time Microsoft MVP. This is a story about picking the right tool\r\nfor the right job, exploring other possibilities, and the difference\r\nbetween playing with technology and putting it into production. As a\r\nnoted storyteller, I'll take you on the journey of:\r\n\r\n*how we stumbled upon Erlang during our dedicated innovation time \r\n*what made it so special that we were willing to take such a risk \r\n*what we learned along the way \r\n*how it performed and would we do it again \r\n\r\nIf you love a great technology story, I hope you'll join me for this tale of\r\nhow this web service, built in unproven technology to us, survived Super\r\nBowl Sunday.",

    "DescriptionHtml": "<p>Would you bet your career and your company's reputation on a technology\r\nyou've never used in front of 110 million people tuned into a Super Bowl\r\ncommercial? Well, I did. And I was a nervous wreck! We were launching a\r\nnew product during a commercial at the Super Bowl 302 days away, and I\r\nwas betting everything on a technology we had never used in production.\r\nI spent countless nights wavering back and forth thinking about the\r\nmillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of person hours that were\r\non the line. Everything was resting on the shoulders of this one web\r\nservice that had to handle the excessive load placed upon it when our\r\ncommercial aired. The technology chosen was Erlang, a mystical,\r\nfunctional, dynamically compiled language that was very foreign to this\r\neight-time Microsoft MVP. This is a story about picking the right tool\r\nfor the right job, exploring other possibilities, and the difference\r\nbetween playing with technology and putting it into production. As a\r\nnoted storyteller, I'll take you on the journey of:</p>\r\n<p>*how we stumbled upon Erlang during our dedicated innovation time\r\n*what made it so special that we were willing to take such a risk\r\n*what we learned along the way\r\n*how it performed and would we do it again</p>\r\n<p>If you love a great technology story, I hope you'll join me for this tale of\r\nhow this web service, built in unproven technology to us, survived Super\r\nBowl Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Sound Analysis and converting sound into light is a complex topic, and there's lots of complicated math involved, but thankfully there are also tools available to help make things easier.  The presentation will use an Arduino and a Sparkfun Spectrum Analyzer, along with some other components to form a real product design, designed for accessibility and/or a cool new way to listen to music.  This is also a cool way to “see” music, and we will have some demonstration time where we will play some of their favorite songs using the board’s lights.  We'll cover the hardware and software used in this project, and how you can recreate the effects at home.\r\n",

Sound Analysis and converting sound into light is a complex topic, and there's lots of complicated math involved, but thankfully there are also tools available to help make things easier.  The presentation will use an Arduino and a Sparkfun Spectrum Analyzer, along with some other components to form a real product design, designed for accessibility and/or a cool new way to listen to music.  This is also a cool way to “see” music, and we will have some demonstration time where we will play some of their favorite songs using the board’s lights.  We'll cover the hardware and software used in this project, and how you can recreate the effects at home.</p>\r\n\r\n",

Are they just academic ideals, or can they have real impact on your day-to-day code design?</p>\r\n<p>This talk is a primer for any developer who wants to improve the quality and structure of their code. We will walk through each of the five SOLID principles, identify their meaning and value, and walk through concrete examples to see the benefits they can bring to your code and your team.</p>\r\n<p>You will leave this talk being familiar with the principles, knowing the tell-tale signs of them being broken, and ready to fix them.
